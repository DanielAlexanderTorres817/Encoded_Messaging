# Encoded_Messaging
A small project leveraging the Adafruit Playground Classic microcontroller to remember and recognize physical gestures

This project involves designing a handheld messenger device for secure communication among five team members, with each representing a node (Node 1 to Node 5). The device uses an accelerometer to encode messages through specific hand movement sequences. Each team creates ten messages (Message 1 to Message 10) to be transmitted securely between the five nodes. The project emphasizes secure communication, feasibility, and proof-of-concept in the context of embedded system design.

The source code for the project can be found in the SRC folder.

This repository includes a video demonstration of the encoded messaging taking place.
